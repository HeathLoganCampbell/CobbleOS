A small OS

### Mindset
I just wanna try make a few basic things for fun, not for production use, not for some greater plan. just for fun

### Let's start.
First, we must start with hardware because you can't run software on thin air.
I kinda wanna go with a RISC-V since even in its name it promotes a reduced instruction set. Simple is good. Simple is a friend :)
So Longan nano seems promising. Cheap. Cheap is a friend.

### Learning the hardward
So the  Longan nano has a whole [website](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/longan/Nano/Longan_nano.html) for him. 
It's a 32 bit computer, 32 KB of ram.
So I probably want the RV32I instruction set.

ffs, this document is massive.
Time to use our best friend GPT to summarise

#### ðŸ§© Instruction Formats

Type	Meaning
R-type	Register-Register operations
I-type	Immediate operations, loads
S-type	Stores
B-type	Branches
U-type	Upper immediates
J-type	Jumps

Looks like a lot of effort, lets see if gpt and suggest a MORE reduce set
