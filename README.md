# CobbleOS
A small OS

## Mindset
I just wanna try make a few basic things for fun, not for production use, not for some greater plan. just for fun

## Let's start.
First, we must start with hardware because you can't run software on thin air.
I kinda wanna go with a RISC-V since even in its name it promotes a reduced instruction set. Simple is good. Simple is a friend :)
So Longan nano seems promising. Cheap. Cheap is a friend.
